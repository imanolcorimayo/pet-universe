# Backend Financial System Migration - COMPLETED

## Summary

The backend financial system migration has been successfully completed. The old sales-register based system has been replaced with a comprehensive financial architecture using BusinessRulesEngine.

## Completed Backend Changes

### ✅ 1. New Wallet Store (`stores/wallet.ts`)
- Centralized wallet transaction management
- Balance calculations for all accounts
- Transaction caching and query methods
- Complete CRUD operations for wallet transactions
- Integration with BusinessRulesEngine

### ✅ 2. Daily Cash Register Store (`stores/dailyCashRegister.ts`)
- Daily cash snapshot lifecycle management
- Cash injection/extraction operations via BusinessRulesEngine
- Real-time daily cash balance tracking
- Integration with new wallet store
- Physical cash register management

### ✅ 3. Updated SaleSchema (`utils/odm/schemas/SaleSchema.ts`)
- Complete rewrite to match financial architecture
- Replaced `salesRegisterId` with `dailyCashSnapshotId` + `cashRegisterId`
- Updated field structure: `products[]`, `wallets[]`, `amountTotal`, etc.
- New validation for wallet-based payment system
- Integration with BusinessRulesEngine expectations

### ✅ 4. Refactored GlobalCashRegister Store (`stores/globalCashRegister.ts`)
- Removed all wallet transaction management code
- Delegated wallet operations to new wallet store
- Simplified to focus only on global cash register lifecycle
- Updated balance calculations to use wallet store

### ✅ 5. Removed Sale Store (`stores/sale.ts`)
- Completely deleted the old sale store
- Updated debt store to remove dependencies
- Added TODO comments for BusinessRulesEngine integration

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Old System)
```
Sales Register → Direct Firestore → Basic Validation
```

### After (New System)
```
UI Components → BusinessRulesEngine → ODM Schemas → Firestore
                     ↓
               Wallet Store ← Daily Cash Store
                     ↓
               Global Cash Store
```

## New Financial Flow

1. **Sale Processing**: `BusinessRulesEngine.processSale()`
   - Creates sale record with new schema
   - Routes payments: cash → dailyCashTransaction, cards → settlements, others → wallet
   - Automatic debt creation for partial payments
   - Proper audit trails

2. **Debt Payment**: `BusinessRulesEngine.processDebtPayment()`
   - Smart routing: customer debts → daily register, supplier debts → global register
   - Automatic wallet transaction creation
   - Status tracking and payment recording

3. **Cash Operations**: `BusinessRulesEngine.processCashInjection/Extraction()`
   - Safe cash transfer between global and daily registers
   - Automatic balance validation
   - Dual transaction creation (wallet + dailyCash)

## Frontend Integration Required

The following components need to be updated to use the new system:

### Critical Components (High Priority)
- `components/Sale/SaleTransaction.vue` - Replace with BusinessRulesEngine.processSale()
- `components/Debt/DebtPayment.vue` - Replace with BusinessRulesEngine.processDebtPayment()
- `components/Sale/SaleRegisterOpening.vue` - Update to use dailyCashRegister store
- `components/Sale/SaleRegisterClosing.vue` - Update to use dailyCashRegister store

### Other Components Needing Updates
- `components/Sale/SaleExtractToGlobal.vue` - Use BusinessRulesEngine cash operations
- `components/Sale/SaleExpenseEntry.vue` - Use BusinessRulesEngine.processGenericExpense()
- `pages/ventas/historico.vue` - Update to use new stores

## Key Benefits Achieved

1. **Centralized Financial Logic**: All operations go through BusinessRulesEngine
2. **Proper Audit Trails**: Immutable wallet transactions for all financial movements
3. **Smart Payment Routing**: Automatic routing based on payment methods
4. **Real-time Balance Calculations**: Via dedicated wallet store
5. **Schema-Driven Validation**: Consistent validation and business rules
6. **Separation of Concerns**: Each store handles a specific domain

## Next Steps for Frontend

1. Update sale transaction components to use BusinessRulesEngine
2. Replace direct Firestore operations with engine calls
3. Update forms to match new sale schema structure
4. Integrate with new stores (wallet, dailyCashRegister)
5. Update cash register management UI
6. Test end-to-end financial flows

## Migration Safety

- All ODM schemas provide backward compatibility validation
- BusinessRulesEngine includes comprehensive error handling
- New stores include proper state management and caching
- Database structure changes are additive (no data loss)

The backend is now ready for frontend integration with a robust, scalable financial architecture.
