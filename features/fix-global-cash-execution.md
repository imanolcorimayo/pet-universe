## üìù Development Notes
Starting execution phase for global cash register redesign.

### Analysis Findings:
**Current Weekly-Based System:**
- Store uses `loadCurrentRegister()` which looks for weekly registers (week start)
- `isRegisterOpen` getter checks if register exists and not closed
- All transaction methods require an open register
- Opening/closing workflows with opening balances, closing balances, and discrepancies
- Weekly summaries and sales register integration

**Key Components to Change:**
- Store: Remove weekly concept, always allow transactions
- Interface: Remove opening/closing fields, simplify to continuous operation
- Page: Replace open/close UI with dashboard view
- Components: Remove opening/closing modals

**Sales Integration:**
- Current: Sales summaries auto-feed via `VENTAS_DIARIAS` category transactions
- Keep: This integration should continue working in continuous mode

## üîÑ Next Session Plan
*Feature completed - no next session needed*

## ‚ú® Feature Summary
Successfully converted the global cash register from a weekly opening/closing workflow to a continuous always-open operation. The system now provides:

- **Real-time dashboard** with payment method balances
- **Continuous transaction recording** without opening/closing dependencies
- **Role-based access control** for owners and administrators only
- **Maintained sales integration** - daily sales summaries still feed correctly
- **Clean architecture** with removed legacy components
- **Error-free build** with proper TypeScript compilation
